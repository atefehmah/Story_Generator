# Story_Generator
This is the final project of Natural Language Processing course at UNCC. 

In the Vist_demo file images and related captions are getting contected. 
In the get_prompt notebook the prompts are collected from image captions.
In gpt_2_final the stories are getting generated from prompts. When you download the model and run the model a prompt box asks you to input a prompt. You choose from the prompt samples or any other one from the prompts list. 

The AtefehMahdavi notebook is not being used but because it was among my explorations I inlcluded.
