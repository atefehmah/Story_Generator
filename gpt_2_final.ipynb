    "### My Idea\n",
    "I was planing to tell stories about single images based on spesific courpeses. However I became familiar with GPT-2 language model.GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model which was published this February by OpenAI. the objective of this model is to predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text.  So I decided to use this language model to generate stories. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can generate stories for a single image. However I decided to go with the sequence of images instead. I found a paper \"Stories for Images-in-Sequence by using Visual and Narrative Components\" that explores generating captions based on a sequence of images. So each caption at the same time is related to the image itself and the previous caption. \n",

    "## Steps\n",

    "###1. Installation\n",
    "Clone the repo, install dependencies, and download the model weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose between the small 117M, medium 345M, large 774M model, xl 1.5B model or all of them.\n",
    "You should enter the prompts into the prompt box that apears after running the model.\n"
